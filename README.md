# WesttownHandProject
A repository of code for an Arduino-based, EMG controlled prosthetic hand.

The main hand code isn't tested as of right now, but the tested servo code (handCodeServo.ino) can be used.

multiEMGTest might work, but it's untested.

Processing probably doesn't work with the old servo code (handCodeServo.ino), but it might. Untested.
